To compare different algorithms easier, I define that

Efficiency = Total Used Memory Size / Total Request Memory Size

and I use the result of testsuite/5.trace for comparision.


Basic Points:

(1) Resourcce Map

Max Efficiency = 98.96%
Min Efficiency = 0.001%
Average Efficiency = 68.37%


(2) Buddy System

Max Efficiency = 71.40%
Min Efficiency = 0.15%
Average Efficiency = 64.69%


Extra Points:

(1) SVR4 Lazy Buddy

Max Efficiency = 71.27%
Min Efficiency = 0.002%
Average Efficiency = 62.25%

(2) Power-of two Free List

Max Efficiency = 70.53%
Min Efficiency = 0.001%
Average Efficiency = 56.07%

(3) McKusick-Karels

Max Efficiency = 71.68%
Min Efficiency = 0.001%
Average Effiency = 57.20%
